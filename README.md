# brushed-DC-motor-system-identification
script was used to generate DC motor model by giving a velocity step input to the motor (24 V)
Code is compiled in mbed compiler and uploaded to STM32 Nucleo-F446RE. 
Brushed DC motor controlled: Maxon RE-32 
Motor driver: High Current Motor Driver H-Bridge Module BTS7960 43A for Arduino Use a logic shifter from Nucleo board to BTS7960 module. 
Code was written to actuate a 1DOF active ankle prosthetic
